					<p>This application was created by DOTD GIS in August of 2018.
						<br><br><strong>Mileposts</strong> are at one mile intervals if a post exists along the Interstates.
						The data was derived from video log data. Locations of mileposts are subject to
						inaccuracies and are not necessarily the actual mileage along the route. DOTD
						does not guarantee the accuracy of this data and should be used only as a reference.
						The data is from 2012-2014 and was digitized into GIS in 2017.
						<br><br>DOTD maintains two LRS Route Networks. Everything in this application will be
						referenced from DOTD's new Linear Referencing Method. This new LRM is called <strong>StatewideRoutes</strong>.
						StatewideRoutes is the foundation for the department's enterprise GIS. A route is described
						within the system from beginning to end. An example would be I-10 which spans from Texas to
						Mississippi. So milepoint 0 of I-10 will be at the Texas stateline.
						<br><br><strong>Milepoints</strong> are derived from StatewideRoutes. Milepoints are calculated for every
						thousandth of a mile. On divided roadways, the milepoints on each side will not be the same.
